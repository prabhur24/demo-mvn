# ✅ Spring Expense Management – Advanced Enhancement Checklist

---

## 🔐 Spring Security (Advanced)
- [ ] Implement JWT with Access + Refresh Tokens
- [ ] Add Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Secure endpoints with `@PreAuthorize`
- [ ] Use Custom Access Decision Voters
- [ ] Propagate Security Context in async threads

---

## 📦 Modular Architecture & Clean Code
- [ ] Split codebase into modules: `core`, `web`, `data`
- [ ] Create layered architecture: Controller → Service → Repository → Domain
- [ ] Use interfaces and abstractions
- [ ] Convert project into a Maven multi-module setup

---

## 🧰 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- [ ] Define Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects
- [ ] Use Domain Events (e.g., BudgetExceededEvent)
- [ ] Identify and isolate Bounded Contexts

---

## 🔁 Event-Driven Design
- [ ] Use `ApplicationEventPublisher` for internal events
- [ ] Integrate Kafka or RabbitMQ for async workflows
- [ ] Handle events for Expense Added / Budget Exceeded

---

## ⏳ Async & Reactive Programming
- [ ] Use `@Async` for background tasks (email, reports)
- [ ] Use `CompletableFuture` for async flows
- [ ] Explore WebFlux and reactive repositories

---

## 📊 Caching & Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement Spring Cache with `@Cacheable`
- [ ] Use Redis as caching layer
- [ ] Add rate limiting (Resilience4j / Bucket4j)
- [ ] Fix N+1 query issues
- [ ] Add monitoring with Spring Actuator + Micrometer

---

## 🧪 Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito
- [ ] Write integration tests with `@SpringBootTest`
- [ ] Use TestContainers for real DB/Kafka integration
- [ ] Create contract tests using Spring Cloud Contract
- [ ] Use WireMock to simulate external services

---

## 🧱 Spring Batch / Bulk Jobs
- [ ] Import expenses from CSV using Spring Batch
- [ ] Create batch job for archiving old data
- [ ] Handle skip/retry logic in batch jobs

---

## 🌐 Spring Cloud (Optional Cloud-Native)
- [ ] Add Spring Cloud Config for centralized configs
- [ ] Add Eureka for service discovery (if microservices)
- [ ] Use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing/auth
- [ ] Integrate Zipkin + Sleuth for tracing

---

## 🌍 API Design Best Practices
- [ ] Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Return proper error response model
- [ ] Use API versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
- [ ] Validate inputs using `@Valid`

---

## ☕ Java Concepts
- [ ] Use Java Streams and Lambdas
- [ ] Create Records for DTOs (Java 14+)
- [ ] Apply Functional Interfaces
- [ ] Use java.time API for date filtering
- [ ] Implement Builder, Factory, Strategy patterns
- [ ] Use `CompletableFuture` for async logic
- [ ] Apply Optional effectively
- [ ] Use Enums for roles and categories

---

## 🐳 DevOps & Deployment
- [ ] Dockerize the Spring Boot app
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Deploy to AWS / Heroku / GCP
- [ ] Manage secrets via Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
